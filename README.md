Virtual Drawing Mannequin (C++)
======

Virtual Drawing Mannequin C++ prototype. This project was started when WebGL was still new and not fully supported yet.
I have the source code of the desktop version just for historic record.

Demo: <a href="http://www.tux.valour.me/vm/dollywin32.exe">Windows Binary Executable (win 7)</a>
. Make sure you have your GL libraries and glut setup beforehand.
